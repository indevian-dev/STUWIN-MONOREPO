## Similarity Flow
Cross-platform parity is mandatory. Web and Mobile must share the same business logic behavior.

## Core Rules
- **Write code for humans.** Focus on readability and effective maintenance.
- **BUN engine.** Use BUN for all terminal commands and as the primary JS engine.
- **AI-Generated Files.** All AI files must be stored in the `.ai-files` folder.
- **Massive Changes.** Always use JavaScript scripting for multi-file/massive changes across the codebase.
- **Rule Synchronization.** When refactoring logic related to established rules, you MUST update the corresponding files in `.agent/rules/*.md`.
